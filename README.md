# ProjectReports

The projects are organized uisng the following structure:

- **C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (CPP)**
  
  Mainly from the problems solved during tha Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization

- **Computer Vision (CV)** 
  
  Projects implemented in Python using Open CV Library.

- **Machine Learning Tabular Data (ML)** 
  
  Projects programmed in Python using SciKit-Learn Library implementing traditional Machine Learning algorithms
  like: 
  - Decision Tree 
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN
  - AdaBoost
  - XGBoost
  - etc.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  
  Projects involving different areas of NLP: 
  - Named Entity Recognition - NER
  - Text Sentiment Analysis
  - Text Summarization
  - Topic Modelling

- **Recommender Algorithms (REC)**
  
  Diverse techniques for recommendation engines like:
  - Matrix Factorization
  - Content Filtering
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Turicreate

- **Time Series Analysis (TIME)**
  
  Time series Analysis using Deep Learning techniques.
