    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Project takes a Notebook from the Deep Learning 1 class as a baseline. A fully connected Neural Network is used for Movie Sentiment Analysis and a base LSTM  Neural Network is also included to solve the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Analysis\n",
    "We analyze the effect of changing different parameters in the LSTM and Dense Neural Networks, and include an additional GRU model to benchmark all of them. The initial parameters to be changed and benchmarked would be the following (but more may be included if our analysis finds interesting results during the experimentation):\n",
    "-      Number of Dense Layers\n",
    "-      Number of LSTM layers\n",
    "-      Test a Gated REcurrent Unit (GRU) model with simialr featureas than LSTM\n",
    "-      Benchmark different number of epochs (increase if the model does not overfit)\n",
    "-      Include the Dropout hyperparameter in the LSTM layers\n",
    "-      Add Droput Layers in the fully Dense Models\n",
    "-      Increase the amount of neurons in the final Dense layers.\n",
    "-      Test different activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "- CPU: 06 Cores Intel Core i7-10750H CPU @ 2.50GHz\n",
    "- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX2060\n",
    "- Windows 11\n",
    "- Pyhton 3.10.9\n",
    "- TensorFlow 2.10.1\n",

    "### Sumary of Models Run\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Model\n",
    "Dense Neural Network with 04 Dense Layers and four dropout layers (Model 02)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric, Loss function and Optimizer Definition\n",
    "To correctly define benchmark the different models, we defined accuracy as the primary metric to assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "We evaluate the accuracy of the training and testing datasets.\n",
    "The loss function selected is binary cross entropy, and the optimizer is adaptive momentum (Adam)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 01: Baseline model\n",
    "A baseline model is the most straightforward approach that needs to be beaten by all the other approaches. From our previous experience, we found that a simple or naïve baseline model is sometimes very hard to beat by much more sophisticated approaches. In our case, we defined a vanilla neural network with only one dense layer, which receives as inputs a maximum of 500-word embeddings with 50 dimensions. We do not apply regularization, dropouts or any other technique to prevent overfitting, as we can see that the baseline model is highly biased with an accuracy of 69%. This model is so simple that runs in 39 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 02: Pure dense layer\n",
    "In this case, we work with five dense layers with 128, 64, 32, 16 and 1  neurons each. The input embeddings are similar to the baseline model. We also add 04 dropout layers to the sequence after each dense layer.\n",
    "We obtained a significant performance improvement: 87.37% accuracy in the training dataset and 85.40% in the testing samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 03: Pure Dense Layers without Dropout\n",
    "The same dense model has been used without the dropout layers. The result was unsuccessful (we obtained a testing accuracy of 82.44%) as the model with dropout layers was superior. This means dropout layer really does its job.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 04: Adding two addiitonal layers to the Dense Layer model (without Dropout)\n",
    "In this opportunity, we add two Dense Layers to the model without Dropout layers. The resultant accuracy was 71.21%, which is pretty bad and comparable with the naive baseline model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 05: GRU\n",
    "We build a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to compete with the LSTM and Dense models. The GRU beat the LSTM but could not outperform the Dense Layer model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 06: LSTM\n",
    "This was the best of the LSTM models, with a testing accuracy of 84% and a training time of 37min. I did not use any regularization or any dropout hyperparameter. It could not beat the GRU or the dense neural network models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 07: LSTM \n",
    "We trained the model for more epochs (150 instead of 100) to improve its performance, as it was still not overfitting. However, we did not improve the original LSTM models with 100 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 08: LSTM\n",
    "We add a dropout hyperparameter of 0.8 in both LSTM layers (only 20% of the neurons are active each). This was to force all the neurons to be trained and reduce overfitting. Nevertheless, it could not beat the two previous LSTM models without dropout and with fewer epochs nor the GRU model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 09 LSTM\n",
    "This is our more complex model with 200 epochs. It took 1 hour and 13 minutes to finish with the GPU, but unfortunately, it did not show any improvement in training or testing accuracy compared to the one with 150 epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "- Beating a vanilla neural network was not easy for much more advanced models. Even though the baseline was beaten by all of them, the second simplest model, another vanilla Neural Network, was unbeatable.\n",
    "- Training and benchmarking LSTM and GRU can be time-consuming and GPU-intensive (a GPU was mandatory to perform this analysis). When running the models in a CPU, the training time for the LSTM models was more than 8 hours for the simplest one.\n",
    "- In this sentiment analysis case, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) was more effective than the  Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models in terms of accuracy with similar training time. \n",
    "- Dropout Layers considerable improved the model tesing accuracy in case of the dense models. This model outperformed all of the LSTM and GRU more complex ones. \n",
    "- More hyperparameter tuning needs to be done inorder to properly take advantage of the GRU and LSTM models.\n",
    "- Testing with other advanced configurations using transformers needs to be done to achieve even better resutls than with the Dense neural network.\n",
    "- Additional testing could be done increaing the Embedding size and the vocabulary size during the prepprocessing.\n",
