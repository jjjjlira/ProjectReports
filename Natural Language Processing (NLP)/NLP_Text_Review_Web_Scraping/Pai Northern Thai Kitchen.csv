Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Nadine M.,5 star rating,"I've heard great things about Pai so I've been wanting to go. We had to wait for a while because it was a weekend but IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. We loved everything we ordered and they were well-priced given the serving. I still can't stop thinking about the papaya salad and pork skewer--definitely order that when you go!If you go with friends, order (almost) everything on the menu and share so you can have a taste of every dish. I will definitely go back and won't stop raving about this restaurant!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Erika N.,4 star rating,"I came with a few friends for dinner on a Monday night. Our wait was about 35 minutes which wasn't too bad. We had a drink next door while we waited. Once we got the text, we went back and got seated. I honestly didn't expect this place to be as big as it was inside. I liked how colorful and fun it was, very trendy.The menu had quite a few options and they did a great job with accommodating my gluten free friend too. We started out with the garlic chicken which I loved. It was juicy, crispy and flavorful. It didn't have a huge garlic taste at all so don't let that scare you. Next I shared the shrimp pad thai. This was great too, really flavorful and big meaty shrimps. Finally, I shared the beef khao soi. I really wanted to like this more than I did, but the beef just tasted so dry to me. Maybe with a different protein it would have been better. Overall it was good. I did feel like our sever rushed us a bit and wasn't the most friendly, but the food was still good which made it worth it."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Mary M.,4 star rating,"On my hunt to find the best Thai food in the GTA, I've finally had the chance to try Pai.Now, I wasn't expecting it to be as large as it was, looks can be deceiving, you turn the corner inside and there's a full seating area which can be restaurant on its own. Reservations highly recommended as by around 5:30 it was filling up fairly quickly.Once inside, there are lanterns hanging from the ceiling, wall art, seating included everything from high top, to bench's & tables.The menu had a variety of options. The squash fritters were a tad bit hard, the garlic chicken was a bit overcooked to my liking, with each bite, I could taste the oil.The Green curry was served in a coconut which was fascinating. They also provided a small bowl of extra curry.  This was very  tasty, rich of earthy flavours, served with rice in a leaf.kaosoi, was also very flavourful.Oh boy, when they say Thai hot, they aren't a kidding that will set anyone's mouth on fire.Even though it was as busy as it was, our food arrived almost immediately, the server was attentive and we had everything we needed quickly.Overall, I can see the hype! I will be back to try the Panang"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Cathy C.,4 star rating,"Yelp Review 2023 #26:When in Toronto, you MUST come to Pai. If you're thinking whether to have lunch or dinner here, pick dinner as they have more items only served during dinner service.Certain regions of Thailand use certain ingredients. The southern part like their food spicier compared to the northern part. The popular dish in Northern Thailand is Khao Soi so, naturally, that's what I had to get.Khao Soi:A bowl of egg noodles in a golden coconut milk curry m with crispy noodles, coriander, green onions, and your choice of protein ((Braised Beef, Chicken Breast, Shrimp, Tofu & Veggies (contains shrimp paste), or Vegan)). I opted for chicken. They'll give you a side of chili, and lime to adjust the flavors. By itself, it's a little bit sweet. 4/5Pad Ga Prow:Rice dish with stir-fried holy basil with your choice of Ground Pork, Crispy Pork (Moo Grob), Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, or Tofu - topped with a fried egg. Served with nam prik nam pla sauce. Spice level of your choice (No Spice, Mild, Medium, Farang Spicy, or Thai Spicy). The crispy pork was the perfect choice. Man, I'm drooling as I'm reliving the moment I was eating this dish. 5/5Do make a reservation way ahead of time (a month ahead because Open Table will not let you make a reservation more than that). Once you are seated, they'll let you know you only have 90-120 minutes to eat. But stress not because the food comes out quick. So, my suggestion is to look up their menu before coming here and know what you want so you don't waste time trying to decide what you might be interested in. Also, they have multiple locations so, make sure you go to the right one.Due to their popularity, the service seemed rush. Not the best but not the worst."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Chad J.,4 star rating,"Visiting Toronto and was told this place is one of the best Thai restaurants in North America.  Well it's it good, but maybe not that good.  Great location, nice atmosphere and pretty good service.  Make sure you arrive early or be prepared to wait.  We arrived at 5 md had no problem but by the time we left a line was out the door.  Best dish we hadn't the table were the wings!!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Michelle D.,4 star rating,Back again at Pai!Got their pad gra prow with beef - thai spicy! and it was the perfect amount of almost uncomfortable spicy but still quite spicy. It was super flavourful and the portion was okay for the price. Also tried my friend's spring rolls and they were good. Service was great as usual. We came around 4pm on a weekday afternoon and were seated immediately so come early if you don't have a reservation or else you may be lining up outside.
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Winnie H.,4 star rating,"Finally got to try Pai after so long! I made reservations two weeks in advance for a weekday birthday dinner for my friend. My friend got the vegan khoa soi and she enjoyed it very much. I ordered the vegetarian pad thai (thai spicy!) ($19) which came with egg and veggies - enoki mushrooms, cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, and leek. It came with a side of peanuts.Giving 4 stars because it was good but I wasn't blown away. I asked for thai spicy and it tasted quite mild to me. The portion size and taste was great. It also came out piping hot! Service was also fast and warm. I would return to try their other dishes- especially their curries. I definitely understand the hype."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Angela T.,4 star rating,"Come back again for dinner. Very popular place and good vibes. The server is very efficient to serve. The dinner only allows 90 minutes per table. Once found you are almost done, he will deliver the bill ( that is only 60 minutes) .The Khao Sai is good. Its curry is very rich. Tom Yum Kung also has strong flavour and have 4 big shrimp in it. Only happen that the soup is not very hot even it is served under a small fire."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Christine T.,5 star rating,"Pai might have been the most recommended restaurant to us for our trip to Toronto, and it definitely lived up to the hype!My boyfriend and I came in on Saturday for lunch and we arrived right before a huge rush. They limit you 90 minutes to dine in, which is plenty of time given how quickly the kitchen pumps out dishes! Between the two of us, we ordered 5 wings to share, pad gra pow with crispy pork, and khao soi with shrimp. Wings - Not as crispy as advertised, but the sauce it came with was nice and sweet! Was still delicious, but nothing to rave about. Pad Gra Pow - ALL OF IT. YES. I couldn't stop eating this dish despite how full I was, but every component of this dish was perfection. The crispy pork gave the dish a little bit more bite and the fried egg was just perfection! We ordered it mild, but didn't taste any kick to it, so if you're a spice lover, definitely order it spicier. :)Khao Soi - The broth was creamy, coconutty, and very very fragrant. The noodles were cooked perfectly and still had a great bite to it. I loved the addition of the crispy noodles for a little extra texture. The broth was really rich and was the perfect soup for a chilly afternoon! Can't recommend Pai enough and definitely coming back for the next Toronto trip!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3338,Jeung P.,4 star rating,"Portions are small but flavors are good!We ordered:Pad Gra Prow, Panang Curry, Squash Fritters, Beef Curry and a few other dishes.I'd recommend coming early  to avoid the wait."
