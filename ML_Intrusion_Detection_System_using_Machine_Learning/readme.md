My very first Machine Learning Project. 

The GUIGUI developed in Python using TKinter toolkit library
in addition to the Machine Learning algorithms for the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) written in Python:

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- RandomForest
- Support Vector Machine
- Neural Networks
